| 925    | 1070   | 780    | Torridon Group Mean                   | B     | yes         |
| 831    | 850    | 811    | Lower Grusdievbreen Formation         | B     | yes         |
| 800    | 811    | 789    | Upper Grusdievbreen Formation         | B     | yes         |
| 778    | 780    | 776    | Gunbarrel Dykes                       | B     | no          |

| 760    | 789    | 730    | Svanbergfjellet Formation             | B     | yes         |
| 724    | 727    | 721    | Franklin Dykes                        | A     | no          |
| 615    | 617    | 613    | Long Range Dykes                      | B     | no          |

* At 1084 Ma, constrained by **A-grade** Michipicoten Island Formation pole.
* At 1050 Ma there are roughly coeval constraints from Baltica, Siberia, and Laurentia.
    * The Freda Sandstone and Nonesuch Shale poles (1080-1020 Ma) are consistent with each other.
    * If Laurentia is rotated to satisfy the Freda/Nonesuch poles, then the Laurentia-Siberia connection satisfies the Kartochka Formation pole (f=1.0, 1100-1000 Ma) from Siberia, but not the Malgina (1120-1000 Ma) and Linok (1100-1000 Ma) Formation poles.
    * The Laurentia-Baltica connection is very close to satisfying the Bamble Intrusions (1120-975 Ma) and Laanila-Ristijarvi Dykes (1095-992 Ma) poles from Baltica.
    * Note however that all of these poles have very large age uncertainties associated with them.
* At 1040 Ma, there is a 1095-985 Ma Kumakha Formation pole from Siberia that can be used to constrain Laurentia if we assume the standard Laurentia-Siberia connection.
* At 1025 Ma, there is a 1065-985 Ma Milkon Formation pole from Siberia that can be used to constrain Laurentia if we assume the standard Laurentia-Siberia connection.
* At 1015 Ma Laurentia is constrained by the Haliburton Intrusions (1030-1000 Ma), but if we assume the Laurentia-Siberia connection it is inconsistent with the Ignican and Nelkan Formation poles (1025-1000 Ma) from Siberia.
* At 975 Ma, there is a 1000-950 Ma Kandykskaya Suite pole from Siberia that can be used to constrain Laurentia if we assume the standard Laurentia-Siberia connection.
* At 945 Ma there are coeval poles from Siberia and Baltica. If we assume the standard Laurentia-Baltica and Laurentia-Siberia connections, then there is a small inconsistency between the Ust-Kirbinskaya Suite (960-930 Ma) and Sweden Dykes (955-935 Ma) poles.
    * Sweden Dykes pole is **A-grade**, so we reconstruct to that.
* At 916 Ma, there is a 927-905 Ma Bratton and Algon pole from Baltica that can be used to constrain Laurentia if we assume the standard Laurentia-Baltica connection.
* At 903 Ma, there is a 935-870 Ma Rogaland Igneous Complex pole from Baltica that can be used to constrain Laurentia if we assume the standard Laurentia-Baltica connection.
* At 848 Ma, there is a 875-821 Ma Hunnedalen Dykes pole from Baltica that can be used to constrain Laurentia if we assume the standard Laurentia-Baltica connection.
* At 831 Ma, constrained by the Lower Grusdievbreen Formation pole (850-811 Ma).
* At 800 Ma there are coeval poles from Svalbard and Baltica. If we assume the standard Laurentia-Baltica and Laurentia-Svalbard connections, then there is inconsistency between the Katav Formation (Baltica, 900-700 Ma) and Upper Grusdievbreen Formation (Svalbard, 811-789 Ma) poles.
    * Currently following the Upper Grusdievbreen Formation pole.
* At 778 Ma, the Gunbarrel Dykes (780-776 Ma) and Uinta Mountain Group (800-750 Ma) poles are inconsistent.
    * Currently following Gunbarrel Dykes.
* At 760 Ma, if we assume the standard Laurentia-Sibera connection, the Svanbergfjellet Formation (789-730 Ma) and Kitoi Dykes poles (762-754 Ma) are inconsistent.
    * Currently following Kitoi Dykes, since it is **A-grade**.
* At 724 Ma, constrained by the **A-grade** Franklin Dykes pole.
* At 615 Ma, constrained by the Long Range Dykes pole.

### Baltica

*Currently assuming a 'standard' Laurentia-Baltica connection for the entire Tonian.*

* Janisjarvi Impact Melt is not in the Leirubakki compilation.
* 903 and 848 Ma poles from Baltica suggests very little movement over those ~50 million years.
    * However, there are large uncertainties associated with these dates, so it is possible that they are much closer in age.

### Siberia

*Currently assuming a 'standard' Laurentia-Siberia connection for the entire Tonian.*

* At 1050 Ma, Malgina and Linok Formation poles are consistent with each other, but the Kartochka Formation pole is not.
    * Note large uncertainties associated with these ages.

## Other Notes

* Best way to do rotation when the pole is from a craton that has been handed off?
* What is the evidence that suggests long-lived Laurentia-Siberia and Laurentia-Baltica connections?
* What is the evidence that suggests long-lived Laurentia-Svalbard connection?
* What to do about ~800 Ma TPW? Currently ignoring it.
* TPW at 1015 Ma? Suggested by Haliburton Intrusions?
